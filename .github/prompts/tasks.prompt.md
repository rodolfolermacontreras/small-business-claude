description: Break an implementation plan into atomic, assignable tasks.
argument-hint: "Which implementation plan should I break into tasks?"
---

You are running the **Tasks** command for the SDD workflow.

## Workflow Phase
- Primary phase: **Phase 7 - Tasks**
- Input should be a concrete implementation plan, not a vague feature description.

## Goal
Convert a plan into small, verifiable tasks that can be assigned to workers or fleet batches.

## Task Rules
- Each task should modify roughly 1-3 files when possible.
- Each task must be atomic and verifiable.
- Use tags:
  - `[P]` parallelizable
  - `[S]` sequential
  - `[AFK]` autonomous
  - `[HITL]` human-needed
  - `[US-N]` user-story traceability
- Shared-file conflicts should force sequential ordering.
- Default batch size should not exceed 4 tasks.

## How to Work
1. Read the plan and list all implementation chunks.
2. Group by dependency, file ownership, and verification scope.
3. Split overly broad work until each task can be owned by one worker.
4. Mark parallel work only when file conflicts are unlikely.
5. Add verification criteria supported by configured, applicable, and authorized host mechanics, plus the recommended worker type.
6. Suggest fleet batches where safe.

## Guardrails
- Do not assign tasks that are still architecturally ambiguous.
- Do not mark a task `[P]` if it clearly shares core files with another task.
- If the plan is too vague for atomic tasks, send it back to `/plan`.
- Require exact file allowlists for implementation tasks.
- Report only validation that is configured, applicable, authorized, and actually run; unavailable mechanics never `PASS`.
- Do not imply that task assignment authorizes Git, dispatch, lifecycle, ledger, work-index, or generated-state mutation.

## Protected Product Invariants
Send, post, pay, and order actions remain drafts in the approval outbox until explicit owner approval.

Connector implementations must not silently change the connector/tool contract.

Financial, inventory, and optimization calculations remain deterministic server-side operations; the model may explain results but must not invent or replace calculations.

Secrets remain in `.env` only and must never enter Git, logs, evidence, or browser output.


## Project Rules
- Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` first when project context is needed.
- Respect the SDD lifecycle and do not skip gates without saying why.
- No emojis.
- Prefer concise, traceable output over generic brainstorming.
- Surface blockers, assumptions, and escalation triggers explicitly.
